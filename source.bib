This phenomenon is both normal and symptomatic for the different processes of knowledge generation and re-generation, and can be even considered to be plausible. However, it is also symptomatic to find terms, which rather tend to distort the concepts, notions or phenomena they want to refer to. This is especially delicate when is about to define and delimitate an epistemological or academic field of research, or when the results of those investigations need to be published. This paper aims, in the light of the {\dq}ethics of terminology{\dq} by Charles S. Peirce (1998), to analyse the concepts information design, data visualization, information visualization and information graphics regarding possible terminological distortions.
